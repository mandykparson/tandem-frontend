## Introduction
As a climber, my biggest barrier to climbing outside is gear. I have some but not all and I have a lot of climbing friends who also have some but not all. My app currently allows users to pick a select the gear they have, choose the area they'd like to climb, and find climbers who would also like to climb that area and have the rest of gear needed to actually climb it! It is still in demo mode but I am hoping to add username info next Mod in order make the app actually deployable.
